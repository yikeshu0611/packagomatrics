Description: Normally, we want to know where is the package from. Even, 
    we want to know the current version of package from CRAN and old 
    version from Archive.
        loadData() loads the package information from current and archive 
    package information. Also, package information of Software, Annotation Data, 
    Experiment Data and Work flow from the current release Bioconductor 
    version will also be achieved.
        where() function will help you to search package version from results 
    of function loadData().
